## From data on linear spaces to data on manifolds
# The **science of Statistics** is defined as the collection of data, their analysis and interpretation. Statistical theory is usually defined for data belonging to vector spaces, which are _linear spaces_. For example, we know how to compute the mean of a data set of numbers, like the mean of students' weights in a classroom, or of multidimensional arrays, like the average 3D velocity vector of blood cells in a vessel.
 
Here is an example of the computation of the mean of two arrays of dimension 2.

What happens to the usual statistical theory when the data doesn't naturally belong to a linear space. For example, if we want to perform statistics on the coordinates of world cities, which lie on the earth: a sphere?

The non-linear spaces we consider are called manifolds. A manifold $M$ of dimension $m$ is a space that is allowed to be curved but that looks like an $m$-dimensional vector space in the neighborhood of every point.

A sphere, like the earth, is a good example of a manifold. We know that the earth is curved, but at our scale we do not see its curvature. Can we still use linear statistics when data are defined on these manifolds, or shall we?

For this reason, researchers aim to build a theory of statistics that is by construction compatible with any structure we equip the manifold with. This theory is called _Geometric Statistics_.

**Geometric Statistics** is a theory of statistics on manifolds, that takes into account their geometric structures.
=> Geometric Statistics is therefore the child of two major pillars of Mathematics: Geometry and Statistics.

## Examples of data on manifolds
Why should we bother to build a whole new theory of statistics? Do we really have data that belong to spaces like the sphere illustrated in introduction?
 
Let's see some examples of data spaces that are naturally manifolds. By doing so, we will introduce the `datasets` and `visualization` modules of `geomstats`.

We first import the `datasets.utils` module that allows loading datasets.

We load the dataset `cities`, that contains the coordinates of world cities in spherical coordinates.

### Pose of objects in pictures: data on the Lie group of 3D rotations

### Social networks: data on the hyperbolic space

We consider the dataset `karate_graph`, that contains the network of the social interactions of the 34 members of a karate club, for a period of three years from 1970 to 1972. During the study a conflict arose between the administrator and instructor, which led to the split of the club into two. This dataset has been widely used in the machine learning literature as a case-study of clustering on graphs.

### Brain connectomes: data on the manifold of Symmetric Positive Definite (SPD) matrices

We consider the dataset `connectomes` that contains brain functional connectomes from the MSLP 2014 Schizophrenia Challenge. The dataset correponds to the Functional Connectivity Networks (FCN) extracted from resting-state fMRIs of 86 patients at 28 Regions Of Interest (ROIs).

### Monkey's optical nerve heads: Data as landmarks in 3D
We consider 22 images of Rhesus monkeysâ€™ eyes (11 monkeys), acquired with a Heidelberg Retina Tomograph
and available in (PE2015). For each monkey, an experimental glaucoma was introduced in one eye, while the second
eye was kept as control. One seeks a significant difference between the glaucoma and the
control eyes. On each image, 5 anatomical landmarks were recorded: 
- 1st landmark: superior aspect of the retina, 
- 2nd landmark: side of the retina closest to the temporal bone of the skull,
- 3rd landmark: nose side of the retina, 
- 4th landmark: inferior point,
- 5th landmark: optical nerve head deepest point.
 
Label 0 refers to a normal eye, and Label 1 to an eye with glaucoma.
