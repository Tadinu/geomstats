# # Computing with shapes of landmarks in Kendall shape spaces

# Lead author: Nina Miolane.
# 
# In this tutorial, we show how to use geomstats to perform a shape data analysis. Specifically, we aim to study the difference between two groups of data:
# - optical nerve heads that correspond to normal eyes,
# - optical nerve heads that correspond to glaucoma eyes.
# 
# We wish to investigate if there is a difference in these two groups, and if this difference is a difference in sizes of the optical nerve heads, or a difference in shapes (where the size has been quotiented out).

# We import the dataset of the optical nerve heads from 22 images of Rhesus monkeysâ€™ eyes (11 monkeys), available in [[PE2015]](#References). 
# 
# For each monkey, an experimental glaucoma was introduced in one eye, while the second
# eye was kept as control. One seeks to observe differences between the glaucoma and the
# control eyes. On each image, 5 anatomical landmarks were recorded: 
# - 1st landmark: superior aspect of the retina, 
# - 2nd landmark: side of the retina closest to the temporal bone of the skull,
# - 3rd landmark: nose side of the retina, 
# - 4th landmark: inferior point,
# - 5th landmark: optical nerve head deepest point.
# 
# Label 0 refers to a normal eye, and Label 1 to an eye with glaucoma.

# The accuracy is barely above the accuracy of a random classifier, that would assign 0 or 1 with probably 0.5 to each of the shapes. This confirms that the difference that exists between the two groups is mostly due to the landmarks' set size and not their shapes.
